# Maroon Debut code repository

This repository contains scripts associated with the publication "Microbial communities experienced during early development shape the host immune system and epigenome." This study examined the effects of seawater temperature and environmental microbial content on the development of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus larvae.

Scripts posted here were used for analysis of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq of S. purpuratus larvae (5 days post fertilization; whole, pooled larvae) and 16S sequencing of microbial DNA from the seawater.

Raw sequencing data is archived on NCBI SRA: 

ATACseq: PRJNA1237379

RNAseq: PRJNA1237378

16S: PRJNA1237803
